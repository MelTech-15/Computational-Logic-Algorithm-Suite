# Computational Logic Algorithm Suite
• Developed a repository of 60+ programs solving complex number theory and series challenges (Fibonacci, Prime,
Armstrong).
\n• Optimized search operations by applying two-pointer techniques to reduce redundant iterations, achieving linear
time complexity (O(n)) on sorted arrays.
\n• Utilized Git for version control and VS Code for systematic codebase management.
